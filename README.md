# YVR_Energy_Forecast
The main goal of this project is to develop a model to forecast monthly energy use for the Vancouver International Airport (YVR).  Budget planning at YVR requires forecasting the cost of energy to operate the airport. An accurate forecast could help the YVR representatives negotiate more favourable contracts with energy suppliers.
